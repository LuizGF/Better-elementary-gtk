# Better-elementary-gtk
Custimized version of elementary gtk theme

I really like the overall elementary design, but some details were disturbing me:

* My laptop monitor is 1366x768 so all interfaces usually are bigger than desired, but the window decorations of elementary are too much. So i made them a litle smaller.
* Borders, borders everywhere, i hate borders.
* The colors of the interface became too bright to my tired eyes.

(I have no experience in making GTK themes. This was my first, so my practices making it probably wasn't very good)
